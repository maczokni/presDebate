# presDebate
This R Shiny app can be used to search for a particular word said by either candidate during the 2016 USA Presidential Debates. 
The app will tell you who said the word more frequently, Trump or Clinton. 
It will also show associated words identified using the findAssoc() function from the tm package. 

It is buggy, and I'm not sure if findassoc is used in the correct way here, so if anyone has suggestions please edit!
